## Processor’s obligations with respect to the controller


1. We as humans can access your data to help you with support requests you make and to maintain and safeguard SimpleLocalize.io to ensure the security of your data and the service as a whole. SimpleLocalize.io shall ensure that all SimpleLocalize personnel required to access the data are trained in GDPR and data privacy, informed of the confidential nature of the data and comply with the obligations sets out in this agreement.

SimpleLocalize.io shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, damage, theft, alteration or disclosure. These measures shall be appropriate to the harm which might result from any unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, damage or theft of the data and having regard to the nature of the data which is to be protected.

3. We do work with sub-processors. Any such sub-processors will be permitted to process data only to deliver the services SimpleLocalize.io has retained them to provide, and they shall be prohibited from using data for any other purpose. SimpleLocalize.io shall notify the controller when modifying the list of sub-processors using our in-app notifications, email and/or blog. The controller is able to legitimately object and may terminate the agreement.

4. All of your site data is stored in the EU, and it never leaves the EU. You can find the list of other cloud services and third party services that we use in [our privacy policy](/privacy-policy/).

5. If SimpleLocalize.io becomes aware of any accidental, unauthorised or unlawful security breach, destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of the personal data that is processed by SimpleLocalize.io in the course of providing the service, it shall without undue delay (not later than 48 hours after having become aware of it), notify customer by email and provide customer with a description of the incident as well as periodic updates to information about the incident, including its impact on customer content. SimpleLocalize.io shall additionally take action to investigate the incident and reasonably prevent or mitigate the effects of the incident.

6. SimpleLocalize.io shall not on its own authority rectify, erase or restrict the processing of data that is being processed on behalf of the controller (unless this is required by law or the Processor Terms of Service), but shall only do so on documented instructions from the controller and in accordance to the data retention rules associated to the controller subscription plan.

7. SimpleLocalize.io shall notify customer without an undue delay if, in SimpleLocalize.io’s opinion, an instruction for the processing of data given by customer infringes applicable Data Protection Legislation.

8. SimpleLocalize.io shall assist the controller in responding to data subjects’ requests to exercise their rights, including but not limited to access, rectification, erasure, and data portability. SimpleLocalize.io will forward such requests to the controller without undue delay.

9. SimpleLocalize.io shall ensure that any sub-processor engaged to process data on behalf of the controller adheres to the same data security and confidentiality obligations as set forth in this agreement.

10. SimpleLocalize.io remains fully liable to the controller for the performance of its obligations under this agreement, even in cases where sub-processors carry out those obligations.

11. SimpleLocalize.io shall provide the controller with all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set forth in this agreement and applicable Data Protection Legislation. This includes making available relevant documentation and records upon request.

12. SimpleLocalize.io shall make available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set forth in this agreement and GDPR. This includes, upon request, documentation of technical and organizational measures, records of processing activities, and details of sub-processors engaged.

The controller may object to the engagement of a new sub-processor within this notice period by providing written notification. If the controller does not object within the specified timeframe, consent shall be deemed granted.

14. SimpleLocalize.io shall, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to it, assist the Customer in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR, including obligations related to data protection impact assessments (DPIA) and prior consultations with supervisory authorities.

15. SimpleLocalize.io shall allow and contribute to audits or inspections conducted by the controller or a designated third-party auditor to verify compliance with this agreement and GDPR. Such audits shall be subject to:

    - Prior written notice of at least 90 days.
    - A mutually agreed scope and methodology that ensures minimal disruption to SimpleLocalize.io’s operations.
    - Adequate confidentiality agreements to protect SimpleLocalize.io’s systems and the data of other customers.
