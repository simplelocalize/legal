SimpleLocalize.io shall ensure that all SimpleLocalize personnel required to access the data are trained in GDPR and data privacy, informed of the confidential nature of the data and comply with the obligations sets out in this agreement.

- SimpleLocalize.io shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, damage, theft, alteration or disclosure.

- We do work with sub-processors. Any such sub-processors will be permitted to process data only to deliver the services SimpleLocalize.io has retained them to provide, and they shall be prohibited from using data for any other purpose. SimpleLocalize.io shall notify the controller when modifying the list of sub-processors using our in-app notifications, email and/or blog. The controller is able to legitimately object and may terminate the agreement.

- All of your site data is stored in the EU, and it never leaves the EU. You can find the list of other cloud services and third party services that we use in [our privacy policy](/privacy-policy/).

SimpleLocalize.io shall additionally take action to investigate the incident and reasonably prevent or mitigate the effects of the incident.

- SimpleLocalize.io shall not on its own authority rectify, erase or restrict the processing of data that is being processed on behalf of the controller (unless this is required by law or the Processor Terms of Service), but shall only do so on documented instructions from the controller and in accordance to the data retention rules associated to the controller subscription plan.

- SimpleLocalize.io shall notify customer without undue delay if, in SimpleLocalize.io’s opinion, an instruction for the processing of data given by customer infringes applicable Data Protection Legislation.
